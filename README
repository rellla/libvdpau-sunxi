This is an experimental VDPAU implementation for sunxi SoCs.

Most features of full VDPAU are missing, only decoding of h264, mpeg1 and
mpeg2 and output of software-decoded videos will work.
Output bypasses X video driver, hence don't try to use Xv
at the same time.
Only tested with mplayer and mpv if other players need unimplemented functions
something will fail.

To hardcode the deinterlacer to always be active, edit vdpau_private.h
and uncomment

#define FORCE_DEINT

then just build it:

   $ make
   $ make install

   $ export VDPAU_DRIVER=sunxi

To disable OSD support for e.g. subtitles, set VDPAU_NOOSD environment
variable to 1 (OSD enabled by default):
   $ export VDPAU_NOOSD=1

To disable VSYNC support, set VDPAU_NOVSYNC environment
variable to 1 (Vsync enabled by default):
   $ export VDPAU_NOVSYNC=1

To enable experimental deinterlacer support, set VDPAU_DEINT environment
variable to 1:
   $ export VDPAU_DEINT=1

and then for mplayer:
   $ mplayer -vo vdpau -vc ffmpeg12vdpau,ffh264vdpau, [filename]
or for mpv:
   $ mpv --vo=vdpau --hwdec=vdpau --hwdec-codecs=all [filename]

Note: Make sure that you have write access to both /dev/disp and /dev/cedar_dev
This partly breaks X11 integration due to hardware limitations. The video
area can't be overlapped by other windows. For fullscreen use this is no
problem.
Note: this needs G2D, so make sure that you have write access to /dev/g2d.
